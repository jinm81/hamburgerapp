## Hamburger

This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize, and follows the MVC design pattern.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.


The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
